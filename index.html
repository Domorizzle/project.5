   <li>Placing videos & music into websites has been so awesome to do, reminds me of the old myspace.</li>
   <li>Changing color to text & also adding emojis has been very fun, i can make my work 
     abit more unique and fun in my own way &#128516</li>
   <li>But most of all coding & learning how to do it has been just so amazing to me,
     its crazy how it all comes together when finishing a project.

<p>About 5 months ago i found out i was pregnant, so i thought to myself since i have the time i wanted 
    to join a class career choice had to offer.I was searching & searching to see if i found somthing i can get into.
    Finally i came across "Software Development" i did a deep search into it, dug real deep and found it 
    very interesting got my attention.I then applied to it, i wanted to waste no time i actually started a bootcamp with
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Freecodecamp</a>.At first i thought to myself 
    "ohh shit can i really do this?", i tried to put my negative thoughts away and pushed myself to keep on going.
    Since i started my course with correlation-one, there where some challenges but pushed through it, i got to admit i really love it
    here.I want to build websites or work with anything that has to do with music, video gaming, science, or 
    horror topics.But im willing to start off wherever i can and build myself up &#10083</p>
